## 🌱 Allotment Action Day: Help Bring Plots Back Into Use 🌱  
**A community “blitz” to reclaim neglected allotments in Bristol**

Bristol has long waiting lists for allotments — yet many plots on existing sites are sitting unused. We’re trying a **new, practical approach**: bringing people together for a focused, volunteer work day to clear neglected plots and get them ready for new growers this season.

This is a **pilot project**, working with Bristol City Council and local allotment representatives, and your help will directly shape how this could be rolled out to other sites across Bristol.

### What’s the plan?
We’re running a **one-day clearing blitz** at the Ashley Vale Allotments site on 7 March 2026. The site has has a number of overgrown and disused plots, and by working together quickly and with some positive energy we aim to:

- Clear up overgrown vegetation and build some dead-hedges
- Remove rubbish and debris  
- Mark out plots ready to be re-let  
- Create a real sense of momentum and shared achievement

Doing this all at once makes a huge difference: new plots appear together, new tenants start together, and the whole site benefits from the buzz.

### Who can take part?
You don’t need to be an experienced gardener or an allotment holder.
We’re looking for:

- People who enjoy practical outdoor work
- Community-minded volunteers happy to muck in and help others

Tasks will be organised into small groups, with experienced people on hand to guide where needed. No one will be left wondering what to do.
