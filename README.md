## 🌱 Allotment Action Day: Help Bring Plots Back Into Use 🌱  
**A community “blitz” to reclaim neglected allotments in Bristol**

Bristol has long waiting lists for allotments — yet many plots on existing sites are sitting unused. We’re trying a **new, practical approach**: bringing people together for a focused, well-organised volunteer work day to clear neglected plots and get them ready for new growers this season.

This is a **pilot project**, working with Bristol City Council and local allotment representatives, and your help will directly shape how this could be rolled out across the city.

### What’s the plan?
We’re running a **one-day (or half-day) clearing blitz** on a single allotment site with lots of unused plots. By working together — quickly and positively — we aim to:

- Clear overgrown vegetation  
- Remove rubbish and debris  
- Mark out plots ready to be re-let  
- Create a real sense of momentum and shared achievement  

Doing this all at once makes a huge difference: new plots appear together, new tenants start together, and the whole site benefits from the buzz.

### Who can take part?
You don’t need to be a gardener or allotment holder.  
We’re looking for:

- People who enjoy practical outdoor work  
- Those on allotment waiting lists who want to get involved  
- Community-minded volunteers happy to muck in and help others  

Tasks will be organised into small groups, with experienced people on hand to guide where needed. No one will be left wondering what to do.

### When & where
- 📅 **Date:** *[Insert date]*  
- ⏰ **Time:** *[e.g. 10am–4pm, or morning/afternoon session]*  
- 📍 **Location:** *[Allotment site name & area]*  

You’re welcome to stay all day or help for a few hours — it all counts.

---

### What to bring
- Clothes you don’t mind getting dirty  
- Sturdy footwear  
- Gloves if you have them (some will be available)  

Tools, task briefings, safety guidance, and coordination will be provided.

### And yes… there will be food 🍰
- 🥪 **Lunch will be provided**  
- ☕🍰 **Tea, coffee, and cake in the afternoon**  
  *(because community work days should always end well)*

---

### Why it matters
This isn’t just about clearing weeds. It’s about:

- Making better use of land we already have  
- Helping reduce allotment waiting lists  
- Strengthening local allotment communities  
- Showing what’s possible when people work together  

If the pilot works, it could become a model for other sites across Bristol.
